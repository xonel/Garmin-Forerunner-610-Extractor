# ----Login Credentials for Garmin Connect----
# If credentials are given on command line, use them.
# If no credentials are given on command line, look in 
# current directory for a .guploadrc file (or gupload.ini
# for windows).  If no .guploadrc/gupload.ini file exists
#  in the current directory look in the user's home directory.

parser= argparse.ArgumentParser(
    formatter_class=argparse.RawDescriptionHelpFormatter,
    description='A script to upload .TCX, .GPX, and .FIT files to the Garmin Connect web site.',
    epilog="""
    Status Output:
        The script will output a status for each upload file; Success, FAIL, or
	EXISTS.  Definitions are as follows: 

        SUCCESS = Garmin Connect indicated that the upload was successful.
	FAIL = Garmin Connect indicated there was a problem with the upload.
        EXISTS = Garmin Connect indicated that the workout already exists in
                 your account.

    Credentials:
        Username and password credentials may be placed in a configuration file 
        located either in the current working directory, or in the user's home
        directory.  WARNING, THIS IS NOT SECURE. USE THIS OPTION AT YOUR OWN
        RISK.  Username and password are stored as clear text in a file
        format that is consistent with Microsoft (r) INI files. 
    
        The configuration file must contain a [Credentials] section containing 
        'username' and 'password' entries.

        The name of the config file for non-windows platforms is '.guploadrc'
        for windows platforms the config file is named 'gupload.ini'.


        Example \'.guploadrc\' (or \'gupload.ini\' for windows):
            [Credentials]
            username=<myusername>
            password=<mypassword>

        Replace <myusername> and <mypassword> above with your own login 
        credentials.

    Priority of credentials:
        Command line credentials take priority over config files, current 
        directory config file takes priority over a config file in the user's
        home directory.

    Examples:
        Upload file and set activty name:
            gupload.py -l myusername mypassword -a 'Run at park - 12/23' myfile.tcx

        Upload multiple files:
            gupload.py -l myusername mypassword myfile1.tcx myfile2.tcx myfile3.fit

        Upload file using config file for credentials, name file, verbose 
        output:
            gupload.py -v 1 -a 'Run at park - 12/23' myfile.tcx
    """)
